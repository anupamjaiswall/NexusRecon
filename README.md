# So, You Think You Can Recon? Enter NexusRecon.

Let's be real. You're deep into a recon session. You have 37 tabs open, you've manually typed `site:target.com inurl:login` for the hundredth time, and you're starting to forget what the sun looks like. We've all been there.

That's exactly why NexusRecon was born. I was tired of the digital juggling act. This project started as a personal mission to build a centralized, cyberpunk-themed command center to automate the boring stuff and get straight to the good stuff.

And yes, this entire project was built with a little help from my AI sidekick, proving that the future of hacking involves both human ingenuity and a bit of machine magic.

**NexusRecon** is a web-based reconnaissance tool for security pros and bug bounty hunters who'd rather spend their time finding bugs than managing tabs. It's your one-stop-shop for OSINT and external recon, all wrapped in a sleek, neon-drenched interface.
